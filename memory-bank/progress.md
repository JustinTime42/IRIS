## Current Status

### Development Environment

- **Repository**: Single monorepo structure established
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub remote configured
- **IDE**: Windsurf AI editor in use
- **Testing**: Manual testing via MQTT monitoring

### Server Status

- **MQTT Broker**: Running on port 1883 with authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with initial schema
- **API Server**: FastAPI on port 8000
- **Docker**: All services containerized
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging to stdout

### Device Status

- **Garage Controller**: Minimal blink app deployed
- **House Monitor**: Scaffold created, not deployed
- **City Power Monitor**: Planned, not started
- **Bootstrap**: Basic version deployed, needs scheduler

### Mobile App Status

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo configured
- **UI Components**: Basic screens implemented
- **API Integration**: Connected to local server
- **Charts**: Weather graphs working
- **Notifications**: Structure in place, not active

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues üî¥

1. **Bootstrap Not Cooperative**: Current bootstrap uses blocking loops
2. **No OTA Implementation**: Update system not functional
3. **App Owns MQTT**: Applications create their own clients
4. **No Error Recovery**: Exceptions crash the device

### Important Issues üü°

1. **No Health Monitoring**: Devices don't publish health status
2. **Missing Sensors**: Hardware not connected or coded
3. **No Alert Delivery**: Push notifications not configured
4. **Limited Testing**: No automated test coverage

### Minor Issues üü¢

1. **UI Polish Needed**: Mobile app needs refinement
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Some features undocumented
3. **Performance Unoptimized**: No profiling done yet
4. **Logging Incomplete**: Need structured logging

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach (Abandoned)

- **Decision**: Apps own their execution and resources
- **Problem**: Apps could brick devices during updates
- **Learning**: Need separation of concerns

### Git-Based Updates (Abandoned)

- **Decision**: Use Git on devices for updates
- **Problem**: Too heavy for Pico W resources
- **Learning**: HTTP downloads are sufficient

### Current Architecture (Active)

- **Decision**: Immortal bootstrap with plugin apps
- **Benefits**: Always recoverable, clean updates
- **Status**: Implementation in progress

### Scheduler Design (In Progress)

- **Decision**: Non-blocking cooperative scheduler
- **Rationale**: Enables responsiveness and multitasking
- **Challenge**: Balancing timing requirements

### Runtime API (Planned)

- **Decision**: Bootstrap provides all system access
- **Rationale**: Single point of control
- **Status**: Design complete, implementation pending

## Metrics & Measurements

### Current Performance

- **MQTT Latency**: ~50ms local network
- **API Response**: ~100ms for queries
- **Deploy Time**: ~30 seconds per device
- **Docker Startup**: ~15 seconds all services

### Target Performance

- **Command Response**: < 100ms end-to-end
- **Health Interval**: Every 30 seconds
- **OTA Duration**: < 5 minutes
- **Alert Delivery**: < 60 seconds

### Resource Usage

- **Pico W RAM**: ~100KB used (of 264KB)
- **Pico W Flash**: ~500KB used (of 2MB)
- **Server RAM**: ~500MB all services
- **Database Size**: < 100MB currently

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Bootstrap Bugs**: Could brick all devices
2. **Network Dependency**: No offline operation
3. **Single Server**: No redundancy

### Medium Risk

1. **OTA Failures**: Devices need manual recovery
2. **Database Growth**: No data retention policy
3. **Security**: Basic authentication only

### Low Risk

1. **Performance**: Adequate for home use
2. **Scalability**: Can handle 10+ devices
3. **Maintenance**: Code is well-organized

## Next Sprint Focus

### Week 1 Priority

1. Implement non-blocking scheduler in bootstrap
2. Create runtime API facade
3. Convert garage-controller to plugin architecture
4. Test command responsiveness

### Week 2 Priority

1. Implement OTA update flow
2. Add health monitoring
3. Test update scenarios
4. Document findings

### Week 3 Priority

1. Implement actual sensors
2. Add garage door control
3. Test hardware integration
4. Deploy to production devices

## Success Indicators

### Completed ‚úÖ

- Project structure established
- Development environment configured
- Basic deployment working
- Server stack operational
- Mobile app foundation built

### In Progress üîÑ

- Bootstrap scheduler implementation
- Runtime API development
- Application lifecycle management

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Docker Compose**: Simplified server management
2. **Single Repository**: Easy coordination
3. **Config Merging**: Flexible deployment
4. **React Native**: Rapid UI development

### What Didn't Work

1. **Blocking Architecture**: Not responsive enough
2. **App-Owned Resources**: Update conflicts
3. **Complex OTA**: Overengineered initially

### Key Insights

1. **Simplicity Wins**: Start minimal, add complexity later
2. **Separation Critical**: Bootstrap must be isolated
3. **Testing Essential**: Manual testing is insufficient
4. **Documentation Helps**: Clear specs prevent rework
