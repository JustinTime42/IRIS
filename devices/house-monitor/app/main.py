House Monitor Pico W application.

Monitors: indoor freezer (DS18B20 temperature, reed switch door) and city power status.

Entry point: main()

Note: This is a placeholder scaffold. Implement sensor wiring and MQTT topics per design.
"""

# Reason: Provide a minimal, safe scaffold that the bootstrap can import and run without side effects.

# Imports kept minimal to avoid ungrounded dependencies.
# Add imports as functionality is implemented (e.g., machine, onewire, ds18x20, time, etc.).


def main():

    This function will be called by the bootstrap after startup. Implement:
      - Sensor init (DS18B20 on specified pin)
      - Door reed switch input with debounce and ajar timing
      - City power status logic (presence via device online / heartbeat)
      - MQTT publishing to topics from `design_doc.md`:

        home/freezer/door/status
        home/freezer/door/ajar_time
        home/power/city/heartbeat

    Returns:
        None: Runs indefinitely when implemented. For now, it does nothing.
